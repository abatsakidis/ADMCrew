   Hackers hit Coke site

   Coca-Cola was forced to take down its Web site this weekend after
   being hacked.
   
   Web surfers trying to log onto the Coca-Cola site today are being
   greeted with the following: "Hi! The Coca-Cola Company's Internet Web
   servers are temporarily down for maintenance. We apologize for any
   inconvenience this may have caused. Please visit us again very soon."
   
   The servers are down for maintenance because the company is examining
   exactly how and when the site was broken into and defaced over the
   weekend.
   
   Some of the pages on the company's revolving front door were changed
   so that they read, in part, "You'll begin to look what you drink, to
   look in your Big Mac...and then you'll begin to understand that you
   are sheeps [sic]."
   
   Carrie Bjorhaus, a spokeswoman for Coke, confirmed that the company
   has been aware of the hacking since Friday. She said that the site has
   never experienced anything like this before.
   
   Coke is just the latest to suffer at the hands of Net pranksters. In
   May, the Los Angeles Police Department's site was changed to read,
   "Death Squad Home Page." The NCAA site was hacked in March and defaced
   with white supremacist slogans.
   
   Government-affiliated sites like the Air Force, Central Intelligence
   Agency, and Department of Justice have also fallen victim in the last
   year.
   
   Coke currently has no leads on the hack. The defaced home page
   contained a picture of a Coke bottle that read "ADM Crew," with words
   next to it that said, "break me."
   
   "We don't know who is responsible, but we're certainly looking into
   it," Bjorhaus added.
